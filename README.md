# Contrastive-Learning
Contrastive learning is a machine learning technique used to learn the general features of a dataset without labels by teaching the model which data points are similar or different.

I've implemented this while learning about Self-Supervised Representation Learning where I've worked with a 3D Point Clouds dataset in PyTorch and explored whether the created embedding space has a proper arrangement and that our contrastive loss separated different entities successfully.
